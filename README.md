# Urban Food Waste Analysis  

This repository contains the project **Urban Food Waste Analysis**, which investigates patterns of food waste in cities and proposes actionable solutions aligned with **SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production**. Using datasets from **Kaggle** and tools like **Python, Jupyter Notebook, Tableau, and QGIS**, the study explores trends, builds predictive models, and designs strategies to reduce urban food waste.

## Features

* Data preprocessing & cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Predictive modeling (scikit-learn/statsmodels)
* Visualizations (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau, QGIS)
* Actionable strategies to reduce food waste
* Alignment with **SDG 12** goals


## Tools & Technologies

* **Python** – Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Tableau**
* **QGIS**
* **MS Excel**


## Impact

The project identifies key trends in food waste, highlights regional differences, and proposes solutions such as:

*  Better inventory control
*  Public awareness campaigns
*  Supply chain efficiency improvements

These contribute to reducing waste, saving costs, and building more sustainable food systems.

These visualisations support the findings of the project by:  
- Identifying **global leaders and laggards** in food waste.  
- Showing **regional disparities** in consumption and waste.  
- Highlighting the **importance of reliable datasets** for policymaking.
