# Visualisations – Results  

This folder contains the key visualisations generated during the **Food Waste Analysis in Urban Areas** project. Each plot highlights a different aspect of food waste patterns across regions and countries.  

##  List of Visualisations  

### 1. 10 Largest Combined Per Capita Per-Year Food Waste  
Shows the top 10 countries with the highest per-capita food waste (kg/year).

### 2. 10 Lowest Combined Per Capita Per-Year Food Waste  
Shows the bottom 10 countries with the lowest per-capita food waste (kg/year).

### 3. Estimated Food Waste by World Region  
Region-wise distribution of total estimated food waste.

### 4. Highest Confidence – Countries with Reliable Data  
Highlights countries with the most reliable data (based on confidence in estimates).

### 5. Region-wise Aggregate Food Waste (Per Capita, Per Kg, Per Year)  
Aggregated per-capita waste values compared across global regions.

### 6. The 10 Responsible Countries vs 10 Countries that Waste the Most Food  
A direct comparison between responsible nations and the worst offenders in food waste.

These visualisations support the findings of the project by:  
- Identifying **global leaders and laggards** in food waste.  
- Showing **regional disparities** in consumption and waste.  
- Highlighting the **importance of reliable datasets** for policymaking.
